## Analysis

Analysis contains a minimal reproducible workflow for the accompanying paper. The analysis is done with an open-source [Orange Data Mining](https://orangedatamining.com/) software. If reproducing the analysis, make sure you have Orange installed, along with the Image Analysis, and Geo [add-on](https://youtu.be/OANsA6fMJKg?si=NNxufpXOHYHVTXcA). Use `main_workflow.ows` to reproduce the core analysis in the paper. A sample of images can be found in the `images` folder. The `geo` folder contains a workflow and supplemental data for extending the analysis with the geographic perspective. Similarly, `walker` folder adds participant metadata, while `image` folder adds image metadata.
